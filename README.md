# BMI Calculator

# Overview

This is a simple command-line Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator written in Python. It calculates a user's BMI based on their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters) and classifies it into one of four categories: Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obese, using standard World Health Organization (WHO) thresholds.

# Features

1)Calculates BMI using the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m)²)

2)Categorizes BMI into:

    Underweight: BMI < 18.5

    Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 25

    Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 30

    Obese: BMI ≥ 30

3)Handles invalid inputs (e.g., non-numerical values, negative or zero values)

4)Displays BMI rounded to one decimal place

5)Simple and modular code structure
